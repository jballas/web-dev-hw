## Assignment 12 CSS Website

1. Who was your imaginary client? How did they describe their site needs?

"My company's name is *Bow Wow Play* and we offer *dogwalking services to busy pet owners*. Our brand colors are teal and purple and two words to describe the theme of the website are *frisky* and *outdoors*."


2. What is the difference between display: block, display: inline, and display: inline-block?

- `display: block`
- `display:inline`
- `display:inline-block`

## Free Response

Based on my imaginary client I started brainstorming. They need to showcase their services with photos and videos, so I'm going to feature these in my 'services' page. They'll want to attract people with a clean layout that has some movement to it. That's going to be tricky, adding movement, but I think if I have static pieces them movement makes sense.

### Colors
Teal and purple. I made a color palette on [Color Lovers Palette](https://www.colourlovers.com/palettes/add). Here is the hex and rgb elements.

#12BCB9, rgb(18, 188, 185) - Teal
#12BC89, rgb(18, 188, 137) - Greenish Teal

#9866E2, rgb(152,102,226) - Purple
#B292DB, rgb(178,146,219) - light purple
#AEA4BC, rgb(174, 164, 188) - gray
#C7BCDB, rgb(199,188,219) - grayish purple

### Typography

- Chewy
- Bree Serif

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Bree+Serif|Chewy" rel="stylesheet">```

```CSS
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Bree+Serif|Chewy');

font-family: 'Chewy', cursive;
font-family: 'Bree Serif', serif;
```

### Placeholder images and text

I found website that let you create [placeholder images](https://fpoimg.com/). You can embed the images too. This one lets you specify placeholder animal images. [Animals placeholder](http://lorempixel.com/)

For generic text I found a [Lorem Ipsum](https://www.lipsum.com/) generator.

For articles I found the [article generator](https://articlegenerator.org/index.php)

Hopefully, that's all I need. Now, on to the coding.

### Coding HTML

I have my basic layout created already, with the meta, and basic html tags. Here's the 5 step plan.

Step 1: basic html layout
Step 2: `<nav>` bar
Step 3: create about, contact, services pages
Step 4: add placeholder text and images
Step 5: add semantics
Step 6: create Contact form elements


### Coding CSS

I have been studying Adobe XD, so I'm going to layout a very rough draft of my page in XD, just using boxes and shapes to get an idea of what things should look like.

Step 1: Rough mockup in Adobe XD
Step 2: Add colors
Step 3: Add Typography
Step 4: Nav bar, with hover using Pseduo classes and hidden dropdown menu
Step 5: Contact form
