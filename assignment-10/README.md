## Assignment
1. Briefly share your design process for this assignment. What fonts did you choose, and why?

The writing excerpt I choose is from my self-published novel, Fairy Doctor Returns, the beginning of chapter 1. It is a romantic comedy set in a modern day London, and the fonts I pick reflex the novel's style. The main font is NotoSerif, a serif font that is easy to read, but bookish and literary. The secondary font is called "Swanky and Moo Moo", which is sounds hilarious and is also fun and silly.

2. What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font? What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack?

A system font is a font available on an individual computer. While a web font is adjusted for displaying on any browser. Web fonts may be downloaded from the websites's server, or stored in another website's library, such as a Google-hosted fonts. The web-safe fonts include a short list of fonts that all browers recognize, such as Arial and Times New Roman. It is important to use a backup font, incase the brower isn't able to download the web-font selected in your css document.

### HTML and CSS assignment: Week 10 Typography

This week I choose to focus entirely on typography and only added a little color. I wanted to experiment with padding and spacing and to see if I could overwrite the css elements with classes.
