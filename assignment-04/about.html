        <p>Emily Dickinson was born in 1830 in Amherst, Massachusetts where she lived all her life until her death in 1886. She wrote over 1775 poems in her lifetime, but only a few were published anonymously. After her death handsewn books were discovered with all her poetry, and over the years have been published. Despite living in such isolation her poetry is vibrant and alive. She corresponded with literary essayist, Thomas Wentworth Higgison and was concerned that her poems "breathed", and clearly they do in unexpected ways. </p>
