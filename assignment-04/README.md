## Assignment 04

1. Visit a site using The Wayback Machine, looking at a snapshot at least 10 years old. Where did you go? What did it look like? How has it changed?

I visited [nintendo.com](http://www.nintendo.com) in the Wayback Machine. The first record is from 1996, and its visual rely heavily on their magazine, Nintendo Power. It appears their website changes with their new game systems, from the N64, to the Gamecube and then later ones. I have always been a Nintendo fan, so its fun to see the differences in their old websites.

By 2008, the basic layout is very similiar to how it will be ten years later. The 2008 the website colors are more white and light blue, like the Wii system they are currently selling. Today their website uses more red and white, like the Switch. The games releases are still a main focus on the page, but I see some similiar game franchises, like Pokeman from 2008 and Pokeman games in 2019.


2. Summarize your experience with the GIT Module. What did you learn? What was difficult, easy, or still misunderstood?

Most of the information in the GIT module I was familiar with, since I'd learned about the internet and World Wide Web from my MART102 Digital Arts and Technology class last semester. I knew about GITHub.com and was using GITHub Desktop already, since I'd learned about that in my MART120 Creative Coding class. We used markdown in that class as well, so I understood how to write READMEs.

If I had not taken those classes last semester, then this was a great review, but I found it a very slow introduction to HTML. I still do not understand what a DOM is, but I understand that it is vital to displaying or rendering a webpage within your web browser.

I am ready for the HTML module and diving deeper into HTML. After reviewing the source code for the class website I was very intimidated, but excited to be able to recognize some of the HTML code.

3. Include your screenshot as an image link.
