## Assignment 04

1. Visit a site using The Wayback Machine, looking at a snapshot at least 10 years old. Where did you go? What did it look like? How has it changed?

2. Summarize your experience with the GIT Module. What did you learn? What was difficult, easy, or still misunderstood?

Most of the information in the GIT module I was familiar with, since I'd learned about the internet and World Wide Web from my 102 Digital Arts and Technology class last semester. I knew about GIT and was using GITDesktop already, since I'd learned about that in my 120 Creative Coding class. We used markdown in that class as well, so I understood how to write READMEs.

If I had not taken those classes last semester, then this was a great review, but a very slow introduction to HTML. I still do not understand what a DOM is, but I understand that it is vital to displaying or rendering a webpage within your web browser.

I am ready for the HTML module and diving deeper into HTML. After reviewing the source code for the class website I was very intimidated, but excited to be able to recognize some of the HTML code.

3. Include your screenshot as an image link.
