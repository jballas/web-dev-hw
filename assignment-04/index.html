    <h1>Wild Nights&mdash;Wild Nights! (249)</h1>
    <h2>Emily Dickenson</h2>
    <hr />
    <p> Wild Nights &mdash; Wild Nights! <br />
      Were I with thee<br />
      Wild Nights should be<br />
      Our luxury!
    </p>
    <p> Futile &mdash; the Winds &mdash;<br />
        To a Heart in port &mdash;<br />
        Done with the Compass &mdash;<br />
        Done with the Chart!
    </p>
    <p>Rowing in Eden &mdash;<br />
        Ah, the Sea!<br />
        Might I but moor &mdash; Tonight &mdash;<br />
        In Thee!
