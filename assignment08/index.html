      <h2>Honey Whole-Wheat Bread</h2>
      <p>A basic bread recipe needs only three ingredients: water, yeast and flour. However, adding a few more ingredients with make your bread tasty and last long. The oil and honey add preservatives, the cinnamon is for flavor, so that's completely optional.</p>
      <p>What makes this recipe special you don't have hurt your hands and wrists kneading. Normally, you knead your bread in order to develop the gluten, but in this recipe we just skip that step and rely on the proofing stage to make the gluten and texture. So, plan ahead if you want to try to make this bread. You're going to need at least 2 days. </p>

      <h2>The Yeast is Alive</h2>
      <p>Making bread is a very flexible process. You can let it rise a few hours, or overnight. But yeast is a little particular. You want to make sure you have yeast that is for fast rising. Just check the ingredients and make sure it includes sorbitan monostearate.<p>
      <p>If you just bought your yeast straight from the grocery store, you probably don't have to worry about whether it will rise, but old yeast that has expired won't work. How can you tell if your yeast is alive? You proof it.</p>
      <p>Watch the video below to see how to proof your yeast</p>
      <!-- include an iframe that links to a video about proofing yeast -->
      <p>To sum up proofing. You want to get warm water, think cozy bath water temperature, not boiling or you'll kill your yeast. Sprinkle the yeast on top of the water, add the sugar and allow to sit for 5-10 minutes until you see bubbles. That shows the yeast is active and eating the sugars. Congradulations your yeast is alive!
