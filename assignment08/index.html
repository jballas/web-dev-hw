      <h2>Honey Whole-Wheat Bread</h2>
      <p>A basic bread recipe needs only three ingredients: water, yeast and flour. However, adding a few more ingredients with make your bread tasty and last long. The oil and honey add preservatives, the cinnamon is for flavor, so that's completely optional.</p>
      <p>What makes this recipe special you don't have hurt your hands and wrists kneading. Normally, you knead your bread in order to develop the gluten, but in this recipe we just skip that step and rely on the proofing stage to make the gluten and texture. So, plan ahead if you want to try to make this bread. You're going to need at least 2 days. </p>

      <h2>The Yeast is Alive</h2>
      <p>Making bread is a very flexible process. You can let it rise a few hours, or overnight. But yeast is a little particular. You want to make sure you have yeast that is for fast rising. Just check the ingredients and make sure it includes sorbitan monostearate.<p>
      <p>If you just bought your yeast straight from the grocery store, you probably don't have to worry about whether it will rise, but old yeast that has expired won't work. How can you tell if your yeast is alive? You proof it.</p>
      <p>Watch the video below to see how to proof your yeast</p>
      <!-- include an iframe that links to a video about proofing yeast -->
      <p>To sum up proofing. You want to get warm water, think cozy bath water temperature, not boiling or you'll kill your yeast. Sprinkle the yeast on top of the water, add the sugar and allow to sit for 5-10 minutes until you see bubbles. That shows the yeast is active and eating the sugars. Congradulations your yeast is alive!

      <h2>Step-by-Step Intructions</h2>
      <p>Follow these instructions for an easy hands-free bread-making recipe.</p>

      <h3>Step 1: Collect your ingredients and Equipment</h3>
        <!-- <img src="./images/step-1.jpg" alt="ingredients and equipment for making bread" title="Gather everything you need before you start measuring" width"" title"" /> -->
        <p>Check the ingredient list above and gather all the materials for your bread. If your yeast fresh? Do you need to take the time to proof it?<em> See notes above about proofing your yeast</em> You need flour, water, yeast, sugar, salt, olive oil, honey and cinnamon. Once you have these on hand, next make sure you have your tools: you need a large bowl, a small bowl for proofing the yeast, measuring cups, a wooden spoon and  a loaf pan.</p>
        
      <h3>Step 2 Measure and Mix</h3>
      <!-- <img src="./images/step-2.jpg" alt="bread ingredients in a large bowl" title="Measure carefully, then mix ingredients" width="" height="" /> -->
        <p> After collecting your ingredients carefully measure out the flour. If you scoop your flour into your measuring cup with a spoon then you don't compact it and you won't get too much flour. Level off the top of your measuring cup. <em>Please note</em> make sure to stir your salt into the flour before adding the yeast. Salt can kill your yeast. If you have proofed your yeast, then you don't have to worry about it.</p>
        <p>The bread dough needs to mix together into a sticky ball, but not too sticky. If you have too much water, add flour 1 TBSP at a time, sometimes a 1/2 cup of flour or more. If you're dough is too dry, add more warm water 1 TBSP at a time. Continue to mix until your dough comes together in a single ball. It may be quite sticky, but that's okay. You cannot overmix this.</p>

      <h3>Step 3 Rising and Baking</h3>
      <!-- <img src ="./images/step-3.jpg" alt="Bread dough risen overnight has doubled in size" title="Bread has risen and is ready to bake." width="" height="" />-->
      <p>Normally, after mixing you'd knead your dough, but we're skipping that step and moving on to the rising.</p>
      <p>Oil your large bowl and add your dough ball to the bowl. Allow to rise overnight, 8-12 hours. Cover the bowl with a dish towel.</p>
      <h3 id="next-day">The Next day</h3>
      <p>The dough will have doubled in volume in the bowl and forms a thick dried out crust on top. (If you want to prevent the crust, you need to cover your bowl in clear plastic wrap.) Punch your dough and flatten. Then roll or fold it into a loaf shape. Oil your loaf pan, and place the dough seam-side down. Push it into the corners. Cover with the dish towl and allow to rise. You can leave it all morning, 4-5 more hours, until the dough has risen just above the edge and forms a round top. This second rising is very flexible. Place your dough in a warm spot to have it rise faster.</p>
      <p>When it is ready, preheat your oven to 400 degrees.</p>
      <p>After the oven is preheated, turn the head down to 350 degrees, and Bake for 40-50 minutes.</p>
      <p>Test your bread for doneness by tapping the bottom. You should hear a hollow sound and the bread should be a dark brown on top. Don't underbake!</p>
      <p>Allow baked bread to rest 10 minutes in the pan, then remove and allow to cool before bagging it. Warm bread, fresh from the oven is very tempting, so don't hold back now. You waited long enough to make this bread!</p>
