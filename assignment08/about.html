      <p> Baking is a passion on mine. Breads, cakes, cookies, caramel, macaroons, you name it and I want to bake it. Homemade bread tastes so much better than storebrands. You can customize your bread however you want. No salt? No problem. No sugar. You don't need to add any.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, my baking career was cut short after I developed carpel tunnel in my right wrist. Kneading bread became painful and I had to come up with an alternative. There was no going back to grocery store bread. The no-knead method for making bread was my solution.</p>
      <p>You just need to plan ahead if you're going to make it. It is a two-day process, but the texture is soft and chewy. Eat it plain, with jelly or as a sandwich. When it dries out, because its not stuffed with preservatives, then you can make the most amazing croutons.</p>
