## Assignment 08

1. Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?

HTML is easy when it is right in front of you, but it quickly builds up into a complex code. I was familiar with most of the HTML elements, and the basic layout of a webpage, so I was mostly interested in adding in details and extra semantics. The forms elements were all new to me. It was fun to learn the HTML5 video and audio, but I found embedding information from other sites much easier.

2. Next Topic we begin CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?

We got our first taste of styling with this project, and I love making the site look more like a website. Adding color is probably my favorite thing to do, so I'm looking forward to more colorful webpages. I want to better understand the box-layout and how navigation and menus can look better. I did not have a chance to make my menu appealing in this project.

## Free Response

When creating my HTML website I felt like I spent most of my time making the content, than actual coding.  So, I didn't feel as overwhelmed by everything, I made myself a list for my coding process. This allowed me to add HTML in stages and build it up. I found a TODO list very helpful toward the end.

### Coding Workflow

1. Basic HTML layout
  - Heading, Meta tags
  - Body
2. Adding content
  - divs
  - headings
  - paragraphs
  - images
3. About page content
4. Contact page content
  - Form elemtns
5. Style
  -Heading and paragraph Style
  -ID and classes Style
  -Table style

  ### Conclusion

  Toward the end of my project I added the style. I picked the wrong colors at first, I used an olive green, and then a bright spring green and it clashed horribly. When I stuck with blues it was much nicer to look out. The style is still very plain though. There is still so much to learn with CSS!
