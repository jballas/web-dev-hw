## Assignment 08

1. Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?

HTML feels like it is easiest when it is right in front of you, but for some reason I can't keep it in my mind. I feel like I am just add stuff in without really knowing whether it works. I keep having to look at my notes and then I've forgotten how to link on the same page. I find it overwhelming when I have to make the content and then HTML. Its very frustrating.

The forms elements were all new to me. It was fun to learn the HTML5 video and audio, but I found embedding information easier.

2. Next Topic we begin CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?

## Free Response

When creating my HTML website I felt like I spent most of my time making the content, then actual coding. Maybe I just picked the wrong kind of subject. I was not enjoying my recipe intructable. I kept having to ask myself if I was making my instructions clear? Then I found it difficult to label my `<div>` elements. What should the ID be? How do I best identify them? Why do I need classes? Is this just for styling?
