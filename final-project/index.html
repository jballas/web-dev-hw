    <h2>Fairy Doctor Returns</h2>
    <h3>Prequel available now</h3>
    <p>After 150 years of living with the fae, Augustus Aldmire finally went insane. It happened in Dreamland. He got an urgent call that sent him racing all the way across Tír na nÓg, the mythical Fairyland of the young, only to find out the fae in question was merely “dying” of heartbreak. It wasn't an emergency after all.</p>
    <p>“Please, Sir-Doctor August. You must help me.” The youthful fae held out a green hand. He was naturally that color, with pale grass-green skin and darker green hair, stiff with wax, and narrow eyes like a cat’s. All the fae had this otherworldly quality no matter what their age, seven or seven hundred, and August had gotten used them over the years. The green youth lay on the flagstones inside Dreamland Circus near the old-time tunnel of love. “My heart. Oh my heart, it breaks in twain.”<p/>
    <p>August snapped. “In twain. In twain. Does anyone speak like that? It’s the twenty-first century. No one speaks like that in the modern era. In twain. By my heart. No one.”</p>
    <p>“Err. Calm down. Sir, are you alright? I do feel quite ill and faint &mdash; my heart flutters painfully &mdash; so I may not be the best judge, but you seem upset. Your nostrils are flaring in a very agitated way, like a cow.”</p>
    <p>August considered calming down and changed his mind. He really snapped. A switch flipped in his head and he’d had enough of fairy doctoring. They didn’t need him. He shouldn’t be here. Enough was enough. He’d quit. But August knew the fae quite well after his long sojourn here, and they weren’t going to just let him leave.</p>
    <p>The fae had been drinking an orange fizzy freezy drink while he waited for the doctor. August grabbed it and popped the plastic lid off.</p>
    <p>The youth cringed and flung his hands over his head. “Don't splat me.”</p>
    <p>August laughed and proceeded to dump the drink on his own head. The orange ice ran off his forehead and dripped off his glasses and nose. He twitched as the ice slithered down his collar and back. He laughed again and again.</p>
    <p>The fae on the ground, and the others spying on the scene from nearby, started to back away.</p>
    <p>“What’s happened to the Doctor? Why is he laughing, Mummy?” A fae youth tugged at her mother’s hand.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know mine-darling, I hope it's not contagious.”</p>
    <p>A few more courageous souls ventured close enough to ask August if he was okay, or if they should call a doctor for him?</p>
    <p>“Yes. Yes. Call a doctor. Hold on. I am the doctor. The only doctor in Fairyland. In all the Tír na nÓg. Me. You better call me quick or it might start spreading. Bwahahaha.” Then August began to thrust his empty orange cup at them. “Do you want some? Do you want some of this?”</p>
    <p>It was not pretty, but the small part of August’s brain that knew he was terrorizing the fae did not care. Once he started being insane, he found he could not stop.</p>
