### Coding HTML

I have my basic layout created already, with the meta, and basic html tags. Here's the 5 step plan.

Step 1: basic html layout
Step 2: `<nav>` bar
Step 3: create about, contact, services pages
Step 4: add placeholder text and images
Step 5: add semantics
Step 6: create Contact form elements


### Coding CSS

I have been studying Adobe XD, so I'm going to layout a very rough draft of my page in XD, just using boxes and shapes to get an idea of what things should look like.

Step 1: Rough mockup in Adobe XD
Step 2: Add colors
Step 3: Add Typography
Step 4: Nav bar, with hover using Pseduo classes and hidden dropdown menu
Step 5: Contact form
