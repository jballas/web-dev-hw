## Final Project: Personal Website


## Free Response
I want my final project to be an author website. The goal of the page is to feature the newest book available and encourage people to buy it. Mostly people find the website through word of mouth, rather than just stumbling on it. So I need to have excerpts availble to try and convince them it is worth buying.

I have been studying Adobe XD, so I'm going to layout a very rough draft of my page in XD. Then I can experiement with the User Interface and consider the User Experience too.

### Coding HTML

I have my basic layout created already, with the meta, and basic html tags. Here's the 5 step plan.

Step 1: basic html layout
Step 2: create about, contact, book and blog pages
Step 3: Add basic div and images to each page
Step 4: Add text
Step 5: `<nav>` bar, footer
Step 6: create Contact form elements

### Coding CSS

Step 1: Add colors
Step 2: Add Typography
Step 3: Nav bar, with hover using Pseduo classes and hidden dropdown menu
Step 4: Contact form

### Issues or Concerns

Recaptcha from google
I wanted to impliment a recaptcha in my contact form. So I researched Google's recaptcha and applied for a key for the website and added in a code. I'm not sure I implimented it correctly.

Script added inside the `<head>`
```HTML
<!-- Google Recaptcha Script from https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/display -->
<script src="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js" async defer></script>
```

Added this form to the `<body>` and a personalized sitekey from google.
```html
<form action="?" method="POST">
      <div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="6LdataAUAAAAAHkIYpPo585VwuKMlanM8FfkkwAe"></div>
      <br/>
      <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
```
