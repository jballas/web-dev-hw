      <p> Leda Moser is suffering from heart-breakitis, which makes her rather
      reckless and insatiably curious. The only cure? An adventure or an
      extravagantly outrageous affair! Lucky for her, she’s in for both!
      </p>
      <p> A lot has changed since fairy doctor extraordinaire August Aldmire last
      set foot in London 150 years ago. He’s just escaped from the Tir Na
      nOg (aka Fairyland). But he’s broke. He’s stranded at Heathrow
      Airport until he runs into Leda Moser, well, she runs into him first!
      Then she drags him along in her taxi! And they’re sharing a room
      too? What next? A kidnapping!?
      </p>
      <p> Leda has no idea about the powerful fae who haunt London’s Underground,
      in a shadowy world beyond our own. To make matters worse, a monstrous
      snowstorm has just descended upon the city and she soon finds herself
      in an adventure the likes of which she’s never seen.</p>

      <p>
      Leda and August’s worlds collide in this charming page-turner from the
      author of the <em>Fairy Doctor Falls in Love</em>. What are you waiting for? Get yours today!</p>

      <p>Ava Clary presents a standalone prequel set 25 years before the original
      Fairy Doctor trilogy.</p>
