      <h3>Fairy Doctor Returns</h3>
            <p>Ava Clary presents a standalone prequel set 25 years before the original Fairy Doctor trilogy.</p>

      <p> Leda Moser is suffering from heart-breakitis, which makes her rather reckless and insatiably curious. The only cure? An adventure or an extravagantly outrageous affair! Lucky for her, she’s in for both! </p>
      <p> A lot has changed since fairy doctor extraordinaire August Aldmire last set foot in London 150 years ago. He’s just escaped from the Tir Na nOg (aka Fairyland). But he’s broke. He’s stranded at Heathrow Airport until he runs into Leda Moser, well, she runs into him first!
      Then she drags him along in her taxi! And they’re sharing a room too? What next? A kidnapping!? </p>

      <p> Leda has no idea about the powerful fae who haunt London’s Underground, in a shadowy world beyond our own. To make matters worse, a monstrous snowstorm has just descended upon the city and she soon finds herself
      in an adventure the likes of which she’s never seen.</p>

      <p> Leda and August’s worlds collide in this charming page-turner from the author of the <em>Fairy Doctor Falls in Love</em>. What are you waiting for? Get yours today!</p>

      <h3>Fairy Doctor Falls in Love</h3>
      <p><strong>No matter where she goes the fairies find her.</strong></p>
      <p>Fairies and odd creatures of folklore harass Lillia all the time. She never wanted a career in fairy medicine, but she can't escape them and their silly ailments. Although borrowing their power is convenient, what Lillia really wants is a simple and easy life. After a disastrous trip to Amsterdam, Lillia now owes her life to the mysterious Baron. He's a rich and powerful magician who can give Lillia everything she wants. Of course, she accepts his proposal. They're headed to an engagement party in Mexico City before the upcoming wedding in glamorous Singapore.</p>

      <p>But then Lillia meets Marquez. He's going to be her bodyguard.</p>

      <p>Be careful of those hot and sexy Singapore nights.</p>
