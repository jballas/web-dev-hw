      <p> A lot has changed since fairy doctor extraordinaire August Aldmire last set foot in London 150 years ago. He’s just escaped from the Tir Na nOg (aka Fairyland). But he’s broke. He’s stranded at Heathrow Airport until he runs into Leda Moser, well, she runs into him first!
      Then she drags him along in her taxi! And they’re sharing a room too? What next? A kidnapping!? </p>

      <p> Leda has no idea about the powerful fae who haunt London’s Underground, in a shadowy world beyond our own. To make matters worse, a monstrous snowstorm has just descended upon the city and she soon finds herself
      in an adventure the likes of which she’s never seen.</p>
