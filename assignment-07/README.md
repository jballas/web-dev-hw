## Assignment

1. Briefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans.

  - `<div>` elements are used to divide the webpage, or to group the elements together.
  - Classes are an attribute used to categorize elements. Sometimes elements have more than one type of class.
  - IDs are an attribute that uniquely identifies that element.
  - `<spans>` are used to group elements when they are already within a `<div>` element.

2. What is "alt text," and why do we use it?

  Alt text, or alternative text is used inside of the image tag as a way of giving your image a description. It is necessary for screen readers, which are used by people with vision impairing. Also, if the image doesn't show the alternative text can let people know what the image is about.

## Free Response

The `<div>` elements combined with the `<style>` gives this website much more pizzazz. This week the focus was on the `<div>` element, which allowed us to divide our website. We also set up elements with a class and id.

### Coding
When making my website, I followed our homework requirements fairly closely. I began with the basics, and setup the `<head>` and finished all the elements inside the head, before I moved onto the main content. In the `<body>` of the website I set up the `<div>` with their Ids and classes, then I went back and added the headings, and the content, starting with the Art, then Audio, then Music Video, the Lyrics and lastly I added the Copyright.

Adding in `<iframes>`` is an easy. I much preferred embedding as opposed to adding in the self-hosted media. I can see the value of having both options available. Having access to all the free resources for images, video and audio is also very encouraging as a new designer.

### Conclusion

It is easy to get overwhelmed by all the pieces involved in an HTML website, but as long as I focus on the basics structure, before I build up the content, then it isn't as intimidating.
