## Assignment

1. Briefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans.

  - `<div>` elements are used to divide the webpage, or to group the elements together.
  - Classes are an attribute used to categorize elements. Sometimes elements have more than one type of class.
  - ID are an attribute that uniquely identifies that element.
  - `<spans>` are used to group elements when they are already within a `<div>` element.

2. What is "alt text," and why do we use it?

  Alt text, or alternative text is used inside of image element as a way of giving the your image a description. It is necessary for screen readers, which are used by people with vision impairing. Alsom, if the image doesn't show the alternative text can let people know what the image is about.

## Free Response

The `<div>` elements combined with the `<style>` gives this website much more pizzaze. Of course, I immediately wanted to start messing around with the style.

### Coding
This time, when making my website, I followed the list of our homework fairly closely. I began with the basics, and setup the `<head>` and finished all the elements inside the head, before I moved onto the content. In the `<body>` of the website I set up the `<div>` with their Ids and classes, then I went back and added the headings, and the content, starting with the Art, then Audio, then Music Video, the lyrics and lastly I added the copyright.

Adding in iframes is an easy copy and paste. I much preferred embedding, as opposed to adding in the self-hosted media. Having both options available is important. All the free resources for images, video and audio is also very encouraging.

### Conclusion
