      <h2>Lyrics</h2>
      <p>First things first<br />
        I'ma say all the words inside my head <br />
        I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh ooh<br />
        The way that things have been, oh ooh<br />
        Second thing second<br />
        Don't you tell me what you think that I can be<br />
        I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh ooh<br />
        The master of my sea, oh ooh
      </p>
      <p>
        I was broken from a young age<br />
        Taking my sulking to the masses<br />
        Write down my poems for the few<br />
        That looked at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me<br />
        Singing from heartache from the pain<br />
        Taking my message from the veins<br />
        Speaking my lesson from the brain<br />
        Seeing the beauty through the
      </p>
      <p>
        You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br />
        (Pain, pain)<br />
        You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer<br />
        (Pain)<br />
        Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain<br />
        My life, my love, my drive, it came from<br />
        (Pain)<br />
        You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
      </p>
      <p>
        Third things third<br />
        Send a prayer to the ones up above<br />
        All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh ooh<br />
        Your spirit up above, oh ooh<br />
        I was choking in the crowd<br />
        Building my rain up in the cloud<br />
        Falling like ashes to the ground<br />
        Hoping my feelings, they would drown<br />
        But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
        Inhibited, limited<br />
        'Til it broke up and it rained down<br />
        It rained down, like
      </p>
      <p>
        You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br />
        (Pain, pain)<br />
        You break me down, you built me up, believer, believer<br />
        (Pain)<br />
        I let the bullets fly, oh let them rain<br />
        My life, my love, my drive, it came from<br />
        (Pain)<br />
        You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
      </p>
      <p>
        Last things last<br />
        By the grace of the fire and the flames<br />
        You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh ooh<br />
        The blood in my veins, oh ooh<br />
        But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
        Inhibited, limited<br />
        'Til it broke up and it rained down<br />
        It rained down, like

        You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br />

        My life, my love, my drive, it came from<br />
