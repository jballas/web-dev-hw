      <h2>Honey Whole-Wheat Bread</h2>
      <p>A basic bread recipe needs only three ingredients: water, yeast and flour. However, adding a few more ingredients with make your bread tasty and last long. The oil and honey add preservatives, the cinnamon is for flavor, so that's completely optional.</p>
      <p>What makes this recipe special you don't have hurt your hands and wrists kneading. Normally, you knead your bread in order to develop the gluten, but in this recipe we just skip that step and rely on the proofing stage to make the texture. So, plan ahead if you want to try to make this bread. You're going to need at least 2 days. </p>

      <h2>The Yeast is Alive</h2>
      <p>Making bread is a very flexible process. You can let it rise a few hours, or overnight. But yeast is a little particular. I reccomend using a fast rising yeast. Just check the ingredients and make sure it includes sorbitan monostearate.<p>
      <p>If you just bought your yeast straight from the grocery store, you probably don't have to worry about whether it is alive, but old yeast that has expired won't work. How can you tell if your yeast is alive? You proof it.</p>
      <p>Watch the video below to see how to proof your yeast</p>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rqmPvs_nHqM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>Basically, proofing checks if the yeast is still active. You want to get warm water, think cozy bath water temperature, not boiling or you'll kill your yeast. Sprinkle the yeast on top of the water, stir,  add your sugar and allow to sit for 10-20 minutes until it bubbles. That shows the yeast is active and eating the sugars. Congratulations your yeast is alive!</p>

      <h2>Step-by-Step Intructions</h2>
      <p>Follow these instructions for an easy hands-free bread-making recipe.</p>

      <span id="step1">
      <h3>Step 1: Collect your ingredients and Equipment</h3>
        <img src="./images/step-1.jpg" alt="ingredients and equipment for making bread" title="Gather everything you need before you start measuring" width"1000" title"425" />
        <p>Check the ingredient list above and gather all the materials for your bread. If your yeast fresh? Do you need to take the time to proof it?<a href="#proofing"><em> See notes above about proofing your yeast</em></a> For this Honey Whole Wheat Bread, you need flour, water, yeast, salt, olive oil, honey and cinnamon. I use Wheat Montana's Gold White Whole-Wheat for flour. A white-wheat isn't as dense heavy whole wheat. Once you have everything, next make sure you have your tools: you need a large bowl, a small bowl for proofing the yeast, measuring cups, a wooden spoon and  a loaf pan.</p>
      </span>

      <span id="step2">
      <h3>Step 2 Measure and Mix</h3>
      <img src="./images/step-2.jpg" alt="bread ingredients measured and mixed in a large bowl" title="Measure carefully, then mix ingredients into shaggy ball" width="1000" height="425" />
        <p> After collecting your ingredients carefully measure out the flour. If you scoop your flour into your measuring cup with a spoon then you don't compact it and you won't get too much flour. Level off the top of your measuring cup. <em>Please note</em>: make sure to stir your salt into the flour before adding the yeast. Salt can kill your yeast. If you have proofed your yeast, then you don't have to worry about it.</p>
        <p>The bread dough needs to mix together into a sticky ball, but not too sticky. If you have too much water, add flour 1 <abbr title="tablespoon">TBSP</abbr> at a time, sometimes a 1/2 cup of flour or more. If your dough is too dry, add more warm water 1 <abbr title="tablespoon">TBSP</abbr> at a time. Continue to mix until your dough comes together in a rough ball. It may be quite sticky, but that's okay. You cannot overmix this.</p>
      </span>

      <span id="step3">
      <h3>Step 3 Rising and Baking</h3>

      <p>Normally, after mixing you'd knead your dough, but we're skipping that step and moving on to the rising.</p>
      <p>Oil your large bowl and add your dough ball to the bowl. Allow to rise overnight, 8-12 hours. Cover the bowl with a dish towel.</p>
      <h3 id="next-day">The Next day</h3>
      <img src="./images/step-3.jpg" alt="Bread dough shaped to size of loaf pan" title="Bread has risen and is ready to bake." width="1000" height="425" />
      <p>The dough will have doubled in volume in the bowl and forms a thick dried out crust on top. (If you want to prevent the crust, you need to cover your bowl in clear plastic wrap.) Punch your dough and flatten. Then roll or fold it into a loaf shape. Oil your loaf pan, and place the dough seam-side down. Push it into the corners. Cover with the dish towl and allow to rise again. You can leave it all morning, 2-5 hours, until the dough has risen just above the edge and forms a round top. This second rising is very flexible. Place your dough in a warm spot to have it rise faster.</p>
      <p>When the dough is risen again, <em>preheat your oven to 400&#176 F</em>.</p>
      <p>After the oven is preheated, turn the heat down to 350&#176 F, and <em>bake for 40-50 minutes</em>.</p>
      <p>Test your bread for doneness by tapping the bottom. You should hear a hollow sound and the bread should be a dark brown on top. Don't underbake!</p>
      <img src="./images/bread.jpg" alt="sliced baked bread" title"Freshly baked bread" width="1000" height="425" />
      <p>Allow baked bread to rest 10 minutes in the pan, then remove and allow to cool before bagging it. Or eat it now when its warm and fresh. You have no reason to hold back now. You've waited long enough making this bread!</p>

      <p>If you want a slightly smaller sized loaf, or slightly bigger, then just use this chart to add more flour and water. The rest of the ingredients can remain the same.
