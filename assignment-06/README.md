1. Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do the serve?

  Missoula YMCA's Riverbank Run has an on-line sign up form. It allows you to register for the race, and since you provide your email the race organizers can contact you with details about the race. I encounter forms most often when I am purchasing something on-line, and have to enter my billing method and credit card details.


2. List examples of a text, selection, and button input, and where they might be used.

The Riverbank Run has buttons to select whether you are signing up for yourself, for a friend or a minor. It gives you text input to add in your name, email, a password to create an account, and your address. You have buttons to select which race you are running, the 1 mile, 5K or 10K. Lastly is a check button to show you you agree to the wavier. Clicking the continue button moves you into the payment page.

### Forms in HTML

It is surprisingly hard to create a form without having a clear idea of the information you want to receive. And beyond just getting the information you have to consider what is the best method for receiving it, a text box? or a button. The fact you can't unselect radio buttons, means you have to consider having a none, or not applicable option.

When creating my order form I had to keep all this in mind as I was also learning the details.



### Coding

### Questions
The `type="hidden"` is still a confusing concept for button.
I'm also not entirely certain how the form is related to the php file.
