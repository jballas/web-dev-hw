1. Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do the serve?

  Missoula YMCA's Riverbank Run has an on-line sign up form. It allows you to register for the race, and since you provide your email the race organizers can contact you with details about the race. I encounter forms most often when I am purchasing something on-line, but also on the UM website when I wanted to do a course search. And when I signed up for a website they had me do a survey form.


2. List examples of a text, selection, and button input, and where they might be used.

  - Text input example: a text input is when you enter your username and password.
  - selection input example: a selction input is a checkbox, such as when you have to check that you agree to the terms and conditions of an application.
  - button input example: a button is often used to sign in, such as on Github, unless you have forgotten your password.

### Forms in HTML

It is surprisingly hard to create a form without having a clear idea of the information you want to receive. And beyond just getting the information you have to consider what is the best method for receiving it, a text box? or a button. The fact you can't unselect radio buttons, means you have to consider having a none, or not applicable option.

When creating my order form I had to keep all this in mind as I was also learning the details.

### Coding Process

After creating the barebones of my bookstore site, including the head and meta elements, and the bulk of the body and the table. Next, I began to build in the extra details to the search form. The code quickly becomes a complex maze of tags, and I worry about missing the backslash on empty elements, so I will have to go back through it before I submit my homework to make sure they are all present.

I added styling to the table, and made sure to use the `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` to make the form easier to read. I found the `<label>` element to be a pain to code, because you are coding the same sorts of words between the id for the label, and the actual text. However, it is way more convienent for a form to let you click on the words as well as the tiny button.

### Concludsion
Coding in HTML is really all about the little details, adding in extra information to your images, or to make the text more than just simple text. It feels like coding, and not very creative at all. I look forward to CSS, where we get to add more color.
