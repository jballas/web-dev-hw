1. Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do the serve?

  Missoula YMCA's Riverbank Run has an on-line sign up form. It allows you to register for the race, and since you provide your email the race organizers can contact you with details about the race. I encounter forms most often when I am purchasing something on-line, but also on the UM website when I wanted to do a course search. And when I signed up for a website they had me do a survey form.


2. List examples of a text, selection, and button input, and where they might be used.

  - Text input
  - selection
  - button input

### Forms in HTML

It is surprisingly hard to create a form without having a clear idea of the information you want to receive. And beyond just getting the information you have to consider what is the best method for receiving it, a text box? or a button. The fact you can't unselect radio buttons, means you have to consider having a none, or not applicable option.

When creating my order form I had to keep all this in mind as I was also learning the details.



### Coding

### Questions
The `type="hidden"` is still a confusing concept for button.
I'm also not entirely certain how the form is related to the php file.

### Issues or Concerns
