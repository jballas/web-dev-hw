## Assignment

1. How many document <head> and <body> elements can a page have? How are these elements different, or what role do they play?

There can be an unlimited amount of elements within the head and body, but the head document elements are only used once, while elements in the body are reused. For instance, you only need to state the `<title>` of your site once in the `<head>`, while a `<h2>`  heading might be used multiple times throughout the `<body>`. The head elements are used to tell the browser information about the site, from meta information about the author. The body elements contain the content of the page and vary depending on what the website is about.

2. Describe the difference between structural and semantic markup.

Structural elements on a website are the bones. They are the bare necessity for a site to be understood. It includes Headings and paragraphs. Semantic markup adds in details to the website from empahsising important words with `<em>` tags to indicating abbreviations with `<abbr>`. If a website negelects the semantics, it will still function, but it will not be optimized for search engines or as user friendly.
