      <h2> History</h2>
      <p>The Atomic Age style from the 1950s was influenced by science of that era. The Manhattan project during WWII successfully developed the atomic bomb, which lead to the end of the US war in the pacific, but this development was also the source of the main conflict during the Cold War. Fears of nuclear war and the Space race with Russia dominated headlines. This in turn influenced design and styles.</p>
