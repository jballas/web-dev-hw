      <p>The main style during the 1950s was known as Space Age or Atomic Age design.</p>
      <p>Round organic shapes were used, such circles and ovals to imitate the atom.</p>

      <h2> History</h2>
      <p>The Atomic Age style was influenced by science of that era. The Manhattan project during WWII successfully developed the atomic bomb, which lead to the end of the war in the pacific. However, this scientific achievement also became the source of the main conflict during the Cold War. Fears of nuclear war and the Space race with Russia dominated headlines. This in turn influenced design and styles.</p>
