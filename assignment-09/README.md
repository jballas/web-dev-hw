### Coding Workflow

This week the main focus is developing a css style sheet. That means less work on the content and more of the style. So I just added a very quick HTML layout, with `<divs>` and `<spans>`. I made sure to add in classes and IDs so I can adjust them later.

I also want to try to make a checkerboard pattern out of CSS. I was inspired by the CSS rainbow art. Maybe this can be my banner at the top. It will be good practice to create this.
